            <h2>Welcome to Mitchell's Software Consulting</h2>
            <p1>Founded by Charles Mitchell in 2016, our company builds and 
            designs just about any software any company requests. It 
            all started off with a vision Charles Mitchell had when he was
            16. He knew he loved coding, but didn't have a preference 
            for what he wanted to code. Charles also loved helping people
            in any way possible, so he sought out opening this very software
            consulting firm</p1>

                    <p2>I am a multifacted and intellectually curious human 
                        being. Someone who not only cares to build things with 
                        a passion like no other, but takes their time to create 
                        the best possible product.

                        I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois and now 
                        attend Tufts University where I am pursuing a 
                        Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a 
                        minor in Engineering Management. STEM is not my only 
                        passion however. I find myself building very strong 
                        friendships with people I meet everywhere. I would say 
                        I am a pretty big extrovert. I love cooking, eating, 
                        running, and sometimes I even find myself knitting, 
                        reading a book, and golfing when I have some free time.
                         Those are a few things I'd never thought I would do 
                         for fun, but trying new things could open up many 
                         realms of many new possibilities and interests, and 
                         I live by that saying!</p2>
